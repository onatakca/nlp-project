## üîç Monitor Training Progress

### In Jupyter Notebook:
You'll see progress bars like:
```
Epoch 1/10
Training: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 1563/1563 [06:23<00:00, loss: 1.1234]
Evaluating: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 391/391 [00:45<00:00]

Epoch 1 Summary:
  Training loss: 1.1234
  Test accuracy: 0.5812
  Epoch time: 7.18 min
  Elapsed: 7.2 min, Remaining: ~64.6 min
```

### In Separate Terminal (GPU Usage):
```bash
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

You should see:
- **All 8 GPUs** at 70-90% utilization
- **~10-14GB memory** per GPU
- **Temperature:** 60-80¬∞C

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Breakdown

| Phase | Time | What's Happening |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Setup | ~2 min | Loading libraries, data |
| Epoch 1 | ~7 min | Initial training |
| Epochs 2-10 | ~6 min each | Fine-tuning |
| Evaluation | ~1 min/epoch | Testing accuracy |
| **Total** | **~60-70 min** | Complete training |

## üéì For Your Paper

After training completes, you can write:

### Results Section:
> "We trained DistilBERT on 250,000 song lyrics (50,000 per genre) for 10 epochs using 8 NVIDIA A16 GPUs with mixed-precision training. The model achieved **XX.X% accuracy** in 60 minutes, outperforming the TF-IDF baseline (60.9%) by X.X percentage points."

### Methods Section:
> "DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019), a distilled version of BERT with 40% fewer parameters, was fine-tuned on our dataset. We used a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens to capture full lyrical context, a learning rate of 3e-5 with 10% warmup, and an effective batch size of 256 across 8 GPUs."

### Discussion:
> "While classical TF-IDF achieved competitive results through keyword matching, DistilBERT's contextualized representations provide superior performance, demonstrating that genre signals extend beyond simple keyword presence to include linguistic patterns and context."

## üîß Optional: Try Different Configurations

If you want to experiment after the first run, edit these cells:

### Try Full BERT (Slower but Maybe Better):
**Cell 2, line 8:**
```python
MODEL_NAME = 'bert-base-multilingual-cased'  # Instead of distilbert
```
Expected: +0.5-1% accuracy, but 2x longer training (~2 hours)

### Try Full Dataset (All 100K per genre):
**Cell 2, line 12:**
```python
SAMPLES_PER_GENRE = 94988  # Use all available (country has 94,988)
```
Expected: +1-2% accuracy, ~2.5x longer training (~2.5 hours)

### Try More Epochs:
**Cell 2, line 16:**
```python
EPOCHS = 15  # Instead of 10
```
Expected: +0.5% accuracy if not converged yet

## üìÅ Output Files

After running, you'll have:
- **Notebook with all results** - Ready to screenshot for your paper
- **Training curves** - Show your model converged properly
- **Confusion matrix** - Visual analysis of errors
- **Per-genre metrics** - Detailed breakdown

**No need to save separately** - everything is in the notebook!

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "CUDA out of memory"
**Solution:** Edit Cell 2:
```python
BATCH_SIZE_PER_GPU = 8  # Reduce from 16
# or
MAX_LENGTH = 384  # Reduce from 512
```

### "Training too slow"
**Check GPU usage:**
```bash
nvidia-smi
```
Should show all 8 GPUs at ~80% utilization. If not:
- Check that `NUM_GPUS = 8` in Cell 2
- Make sure no other process is using GPUs

### "Accuracy lower than expected"
This is normal! Results vary by:
- Random seed (¬±1-2%)
- Data sampling (¬±1%)
- Early stopping (if model hasn't converged)

**If accuracy < 62% after 10 epochs:**
- Try running for 15 epochs
- Check training loss is still decreasing
- Ensure all 8 GPUs are being used
