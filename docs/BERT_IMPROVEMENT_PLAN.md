## Problems Identified

### 1. ❌ ONLY 10,000 Samples Per Genre
**Current:**
- Training on 40,000 songs (8K per genre)
- Test on 10,000 songs (2K per genre)

**Available:**
- 494,988 songs total (~100K per genre)
- You're using only **8%** of your data!

**Impact:** Severe underfitting, especially for complex patterns

---

### 2. ❌ Only 3 Epochs
**Current:** 3 epochs = 7.5 minutes total training

**Problem:** BERT typically needs **5-10 epochs** to converge properly

**Evidence:** Loss still decreasing at epoch 3:
- Epoch 1: 1.3707
- Epoch 2: 1.0525
- Epoch 3: 0.9812 ← Still improving!

**Impact:** Model hasn't finished learning

---

### 3. ❌ Pop Genre Still Failing
- Pop recall: **26.8%** (worst by far)
- Only correctly identifies 536 out of 2000 Pop songs
- Confuses Pop with Rock (64.1% of Pop → Rock)

**Why:** Pop is too diverse, lacks distinctive markers

---

### 4. ⚠️ Small Batch Size Effects
- Effective batch size: 512
- Could go larger with your 8 GPUs
- Larger batches = more stable gradients = better learning

---

## Improvement Plan (Ranked by Impact)

### 🥇 Priority 1: Use More Data (Expected: +3-5% accuracy)
**Change:** 10K → 50K samples per genre

**Update cell-5:**
```python
SAMPLES_PER_GENRE = 50000  # Changed from 10000
```

**Impact:**
- Training on 200K songs instead of 40K (5x more)
- Better representation of genre diversity
- Especially helps Pop (more varied examples)

**Cost:** 5x longer training (~12 min/epoch instead of 2.5)
- Still only **60 minutes** for 5 epochs (vs 3.5 hours with old method!)

---

### 🥈 Priority 2: Train for More Epochs (Expected: +2-3% accuracy)
**Change:** 3 → 10 epochs

**Update cell-13:**
```python
EPOCHS = 10  # Changed from 3
```

**Impact:**
- Model fully converges
- Better fine-tuning of classifier layer
- Loss should plateau around epoch 7-8

**Cost:** With 50K samples, ~120 minutes total (2 hours)

---

### 🥉 Priority 3: Longer Sequences (Expected: +1-2% accuracy)
**Change:** 256 → 512 tokens

**Update cell-9:**
```python
MAX_LENGTH = 512  # Changed from 256
```

**Impact:**
- Captures more context from lyrics
- Better for longer songs (especially Rap)
- Average lyrics: 278 words ≈ 350 tokens

**Cost:** ~1.5x slower per epoch (but still fast with optimizations)

---

### 🏅 Priority 4: Try DistilBERT (Expected: Similar accuracy, 2x faster)

**YES, DistilBERT is valid!** It's a standard approach:
- **40% smaller** than BERT
- **60% faster**
- **Retains 97% of BERT's performance**
- Used in many published papers

**Change in cell-9:**
```python
MODEL_NAME = 'distilbert-base-multilingual-cased'  # Changed from bert-base
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster training (~1.5 min/epoch instead of 2.5)
- Can train on even more data
- Often performs similarly to BERT

**Trade-off:** Slightly less capacity (66M vs 177M parameters)

---

### 🎯 Priority 5: Hyperparameter Tuning (Expected: +1-2% accuracy)

**Learning Rate:**
```python
# Try different learning rates
LEARNING_RATE = 3e-5  # Default: 2e-5
# Or 5e-5 for faster convergence
```

**Warmup:**
```python
# More warmup for larger datasets
num_warmup_steps=int(0.2 * total_steps)  # 20% instead of 10%
```

**Weight Decay:**
```python
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=LEARNING_RATE, weight_decay=0.01)
```

---

## Recommended Experiments

### Experiment 1: Quick Win (15 minutes)
**Goal:** See if more epochs helps

```python
SAMPLES_PER_GENRE = 10000  # Keep same
EPOCHS = 10  # Increase from 3
MAX_LENGTH = 256  # Keep same
```

**Expected:** 61-62% accuracy
**Time:** ~25 minutes total

---

### Experiment 2: More Data (1 hour)
**Goal:** Maximum performance with BERT

```python
SAMPLES_PER_GENRE = 50000  # 5x more data
EPOCHS = 10
MAX_LENGTH = 512  # Longer context
LEARNING_RATE = 3e-5  # Slightly higher
```

**Expected:** 63-66% accuracy
**Time:** ~2 hours total

---

### Experiment 3: DistilBERT Fast (30 minutes)
**Goal:** Test DistilBERT efficiency

```python
MODEL_NAME = 'distilbert-base-multilingual-cased'
SAMPLES_PER_GENRE = 50000
EPOCHS = 10
MAX_LENGTH = 512
```

**Expected:** 62-65% accuracy
**Time:** ~1 hour total (faster than BERT)

---

## What About the Full Dataset?

**Full dataset = 94,988 per genre (country has least)**

**Would it help?**
- ✅ Yes, likely +1-2% more accuracy
- ❌ But diminishing returns after 50K samples
- ⏱️ Training time: ~4-5 hours for 10 epochs

**Recommendation:**
- Start with 50K per genre (sweet spot)
- If accuracy is still below 65%, try full dataset

---

## Expected Final Results

### Conservative Estimate (Experiment 2):
| Configuration | Expected Accuracy | Time |
|---------------|-------------------|------|
| Current (10K, 3 epochs) | 60.4% | 7 min |
| + More epochs (10K, 10 epochs) | 61.5% | 25 min |
| + More data (50K, 10 epochs, 512 tokens) | **64-66%** | 2 hours |
| + DistilBERT (50K, 10 epochs, 512 tokens) | **63-65%** | 1 hour |

### Optimistic Estimate:
- With tuning + full dataset: **66-68%** accuracy
- Still won't beat perfect TF-IDF, but shows deep learning value
